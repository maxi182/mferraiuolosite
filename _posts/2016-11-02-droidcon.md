First time in a huge event like this, I must say London should be the Android capital in Europe. 
Keep in mind many people came from different places from the globe to this droidcon;it is not rare to hear some english american accents around.

The conference took place at the Business Design Center, a huge place in Islington allocated for this kind of event and exhibition.

We started early, 8 AM we were queueing to start the first day (Thursday 27 Oct) looking forward to what is was comming…

Before the first keynote, it is the important first impression to have a look around the venue, talk to someone, realise there is an Android community out there and probably most of that people you may know from a library is right there, which is pretty amazing. As droidcon is focused in development it was insightful to learn about what code architectures and libraries others devs are using.

## The talks

As usual, Google sends a number of their developers along to deliver talks on various aspects of the platform. Chris Banes, who is responsible for some of the Android support libraries, delivered a talk on the inner workings of the Design Support Library – a library provided by Google to assist developers in implementing Material Design in their apps, with explanations of why things are the way they are. I’ve often had to delve deep in to the Design Support Library to debug issues and it was interesting to learn about why the APIs of the library are designed the way they are.

Chet Haase was not absent, Droidcon London is not complete with Chet Haase’s end-of-day-one light-hearted comedy keynote, nor his start-of-day-two keynote on what’s new in the Android platform.

Another one, that you as a developer really expect to see here is Jake Warthon, he delivered another talk about Retrofit 2.0, nothing really unknown but he gave a good general overview of how to implement it. He talked about interceptors with new approaches, converters, call Adapters and he also mentioned something not very usual, a Mock mode which you can add to retrofit to simulate a networking call, very useful for testing purposes.

Speakers have stricted 45 minutes to make their presentation and talks are targeting any kind of seniority, as the speakers are presenting a new tool or new SDK feature or a library and is up to each developer go deeper as he wishes.

It’s impossible to attend all of the sessions as 72 experts were talking.  However, Skills Matter publish videos of the talks on their site soon after the conference, so take a look if you are willing to see what Droidcon is about.  
My schedule was as follows, the talks were all recorded so I'm providing the link to them.

## About the organization of the event.


The place was a little full for its capacity as 1500 people is a big number.., but not a big deal for developers. 

###### Scheduling rooms:
As five talks had been carried out simultaneously, five diferents rooms were available.  
The procedure to schedule those rooms was a little old fashioned for this kind of event as the attendees had to make a tick next to the event written on a blackboard so organizers knows roughly the amount of attendees each talk is going to take.

![Blackboard schedule](/assets/article_images/2016-11-2-droidconuk2016/29969062844_a90356b3dd_z.jpg)

I'm saying old because probably, being one of the main Android event over Europe, the organisers should consider building at least an Android application to manage this, doing that would avoid people crowding in front of the blackboards, everyone would know instantly which the next talk and room name are, not only that, also can be re use for incoming years applying new features to the app. Of course it should be an open source code shared in gitHub where all of us can contribute... I think as Skills Matter is the organiser, they should be in charge of accepting those pull request.


###### Food:

I think it's also important to mention the lunch.
The main dish was Lasagna of meat / vegetarian, with rice and salad as a side.  

Well, overall should be something acceptable for the amount of people and small gap of time to serve them all. But considering the price of the ticket, the organizers should be serving something much better.  
The portions were small, if your talk extends more than it should, then you can have delays to be served as you will be at the end of a long queue.  
Coffe and tea was fine, but I think they should have provided biscuits (or some other snack during afternoon) at all times, you have to be very lucky to get one, as the ones they served run out very fast.

###### Party at Night:

They did a fun thing Thursday night, just after the first day of talks, some old red London buses were ready to pick us all to go to the Codenode building.  
We were able to get 2 free drinks at the place. The environment was perfect to talk and break out of his shell.
The good and the bad aspect was that another day of Droidcon would start early the next day.


![Party](/assets/article_images/2016-11-2-droidconuk2016/30305464690_1bdc24e702_z.jpg)



###### Ticket Price:

In my case I was lucky as my company paid for the ticket. But the price is actually nothing cheap.
The price raise in 3 stages.  
Is starting at **£95 + VAT**, for the first days after the Droidcon the year before.  
Raise to **£195 + VAT** and couple of weeks before the conference, raise again up to **£525 + VAT** .. so yes, if you are looking forward to go, you really need to book in advance.
