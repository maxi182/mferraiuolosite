# Who am I?

I'm an Argentinean (son of Italians) System Engineer, currently living in London as a professional experience since October 2015.
At the moment I am working as Android Developer in [Ostmodern](https://ostmodern.co.uk), building the BBC player app. Check out our portfolio!
Before came to London, I was working at [Globant](https://globant.com) as a part of the JP Morgan Chase Android team in Delaware, NY.


# What is doing an Argentinean Android dev in London?

Well, What I love more from this amazing city, is the mix of people you can meet, sharing a lot of professional experiences with people all around the globe. 
I also love London dev talks, which you can find them very often, with speakers from the most important tech companies, perfect places to exchange knowledge with others and be up to date with the tech market in the area.
